 📚 Welcome to Yalin Website
 This is my website! Currently, I am a student struggling in the deep sea of economics and math. Because life is too bitter, I always wants to add some sugar: a heavy fan of _Shameless_ and _Family Guy_. I knows a little bit about psychology and history, sentimental but always joking. I live a spontaneous life, often letting my thoughts wander aimlessly. When travelling outside, I must take a picture of the road under my feet. The purpose of building this website is also the same: to record my thoughts and reflections, so that I could track the path I have walked in my life.
